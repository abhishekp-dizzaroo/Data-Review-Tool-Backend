5. Show subjects who enrolled after January 1, 2023.

## Adverse Event Queries

6. Find all severe adverse events and the subjects who experienced them.

7. Which treatment arm has the highest number of related adverse events?

8. List all subjects who had an adverse event that lasted longer than 14 days.

9. How many subjects experienced at least one severe or life-threatening adverse event?

10. Show me subjects with ongoing adverse events (those without an end date).

## Laboratory Test Queries

11. What is the average hemoglobin value for subjects in each arm at the baseline visit?

12. Find subjects who have abnormal ALT values (outside the normal range).

13. Show the trend of WBC counts across visits for subject 101.

14. Compare average lab values between treatment arms for the Week 4 visit.

15. Which subjects have had a lab value increase by more than 50% between any two consecutive visits?

## Tumor Response Queries

16. List all subjects who achieved a complete response (CR) at any visit.

17. How many subjects had progressive disease (PD) as assessed by Independent reviewers?

18. Compare response rates between treatment arms at the Week 8 visit.

19. Find subjects whose response status changed from stable disease (SD) to partial response (PR) between visits.

20. Show the distribution of response categories by treatment arm.

## Complex Queries

21. Find subjects who experienced severe adverse events after achieving a complete or partial response.

22. Which subjects had abnormal liver function tests (ALT or AST) and related adverse events at the same time?

23. Compare the adverse event profiles between subjects who achieved a response (CR or PR) and those who didn't.

24. Show the correlation between lab abnormalities and tumor response outcomes.

25. Identify subjects who withdrew from the study after experiencing severe adverse events.

## Time-Based Analysis

26. What is the average time from enrollment to first response for subjects in each treatment arm?

27. Find subjects who experienced adverse events within the first month of enrollment.

28. How does the lab value trajectory correlate with tumor response over time?

29. Show the progression of response status for each subject across all visits.

30. Which month had the highest enrollment of subjects?
